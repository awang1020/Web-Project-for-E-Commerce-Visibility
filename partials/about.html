      <h2>Chef Inés Roldán brings the market to your table</h2>
      <p>
        Casa Sabor was founded by chef Inés and her brother Mateo, inspired by childhood summers spent in their
        grandmother's seaside kitchen. Every morning we source seafood from Barceloneta and vegetables from
        Mercat de Santa Caterina. The result? Dishes with warmth, soul, and a touch of playful innovation.

      <ul class="pillars">
        <li><strong>Local & seasonal:</strong> partnerships with 18 Catalan farms and fishing families.</li>
        <li><strong>House made:</strong> sourdough focaccia, romesco, and desserts baked daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainably minded:</strong> zero single-use plastics and a low-waste kitchen program.</li>
      </ul>

        “Our kitchen honors tradition while welcoming new ideas. We taste every sauce, char every pepper, and
        greet every guest like family.” — Chef Inés Roldán
